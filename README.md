# COMS3101 - Python Programming Language

**Fall 2015**

Final project for the Python Programming Language course at Columbia University.


## Travelling Salesman Solution using Genetic Algorithm

This is a simulation GUI that allows the user to insert an unlimited number of cities coordinates, which will be shown on a “map”, and then see the solution for the Travelling Salesman Problem (called TSP from this point) given by a Genetic Algorithm (called GA from this point). The user can also change the algorithm parameters (described below) to check how the algorithm will (not) converge given a number of iterations.

Given a map containing 13 cities (as the example available on the project), an exhaustive algorithm written in Python would take several hours to check all possibilities and find the best one, while the GA implemented on this project is able to reach same result within 15 seconds.
